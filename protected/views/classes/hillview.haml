        %p Improve your writing through Writing Workouts!
        %p Writing Workouts feature short, in-class exercises designed to complement Hillviewâ€™s class work.  Seminars will be highly interactive and fun. Students will participate and practice the common criteria needed to write well in any genre: Voice, Audience, Structure and Editing (VASE).
        %p Class will meet one hour per week after school and class size is limited to 15 students.  Students will have the opportunity to review, discuss and present their writing, including writing for school assignments.  No homework will be given.  Join at any time.  Fees will be prorated.
