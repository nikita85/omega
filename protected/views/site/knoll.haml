        %h2 Course description
        %p This course is specifically designed for high school students, although entering 8th graders will be allowed at instructor’s discretion. Each day will feature one short literary piece to be read in class for discussion and as the subject of a timed essay. Students will learn basic terms used in literary analysis and read sample literary analysis. Actual works used may be based on students’ assigned summer reading lists.
