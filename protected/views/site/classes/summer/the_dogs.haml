        %p Empathy is the ability to imagine the emotions and feelings of another being. Daniel Pink’s book A Whole New Mind also considers this “right-brained” ability as another way to improve creativity. In this course students will image their life as a dog. As the domestic animal with the greatest variety, a dog exists for every personal preference. Students will find theirs by creating a dog character and a 1st person Point of View (POV) narrative in both graphic (cartoon) and written form. The dog as character and metaphor in literature, arts and film will also be discussed, including written and audio excerpts. Instructor may invite special doggie guests.
